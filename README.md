# hello_world
A repository for no other reason.

This repository is hello_world. It is the first repository created on the fresh, new GitHub.com account ArthurStart, which fittingly belongs to me: Arthur Start. It has no purpose, other than to help me learn to use git before I do anything more interesting.

If you're reading this and you aren't me, then you've taken a wrong turn somewhere. Get back to work.
